## Building

The CN tutorial is built using [Material for
MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).

Dependencies:
* python 3.x
* pip

```bash
# Install Material for MkDocs
pip install mkdocs-material

# Build the tutorial
make
```

### Hosting locally

You can start a local server that automatically renders changes to the tutorial
files.  This is useful while editing the tutorial.

```bash
# Run the docs locally
make serve
```

View at: http://localhost:8000/

Install dependencies: [asciidoctor](https://asciidoctor.org/).

## Tutorial examples

The tutorial examples live in [src/examples](./src/examples).

As part of building the tutorial, the examples are lightly preprocessed to
produce solutions and exercises (solutions with the CN specifications removed).

Run `make exercises` to produce the exercises and solutions in the `docs`
directory.

### Testing the tutorial examples

Follow these steps `make check-tutorial` to check that all examples in the tutorial have working solutions (except tests with names `*.broken.c`, which are expected to fail).

1. Install CN (follow steps in [the tutorial](https://rems-project.github.io/cn-tutorial/
))
2. Run `make check-tutorial`

## CN example archive 

The subdirectory `src/example-archive` includes many more examples of CN proofs, both working and broken. See [the README](./src/example-archive/README.md) for a description how these examples are organized. 

Install CN and run `make check-archive` to check all examples in the example archive.
