# More on Numeric Types

- Signed numeric types, sizes, conversions, overflow, etc.
    - abs.c is a good exercise (probably we'd just move it entirely,
      along with the paragraph above it)
    - Checking for UB
         - Note that the verification tutorial *begins* with an example that
           testing doesn't handle at all!
