# Unit Testing (optional)

(We currently go straight to PBT, because unit testing might be
integrated with build systems, unit testing infrastructure, etc., so
more complicated to set up.  Hard to predict exactly how this will
look as we scale.)

- Hello-world example of unit testing

- instructions for running unit tests themselves
    - an exercise to try it out on min3
    - an exercise to find a bug in a variant of min3
    - couple more (similar, optional) exercises

TODO: Complete instructions for running Fulminate on the min3 example.
