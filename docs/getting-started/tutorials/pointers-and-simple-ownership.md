# Pointer and Simple Ownership

So far we’ve only considered example functions manipulating integer values. Verification becomes more interesting and challenging when _pointers_ are involved, because the safety of memory accesses via pointers has to be verified.

CN uses _separation logic resources_ and the concept of _ownership_ to reason about memory accesses. A resource is the permission to access a region of memory. Unlike logical constraints, resource ownership is _unique_, meaning resources cannot be duplicated.

Let’s look at a simple example. The function `read` takes an `int` pointer `p` and returns the pointee value.

```c title="exercises/read.c"
--8<--
exercises/read.c
--8<--
```

Running CN on this example produces the following error:

```
cn verify exercises/read.c
[1/1]: read
exercises/read.c:3:10: error: Missing resource for reading
return \*p;
^~
Resource needed: Owned<signed int>(p)
Consider the state in /var/folders/\_v/ndl32wpj4bb3y9dg11rvc8ph0000gn/T/state_403624.html
```

For the read `*p` to be safe, ownership of a resource is missing: a resource `Owned<signed int>(p)`.

### Owned resources

<!-- TODO: BCP: Perhaps this is a good time for one last discussion of the keyword "Owned", which I have never found very helpful: the resource itself isn't owned -- it's a description of something that _can_ be owned. (It's "take" that does the owning.) Moreover, "Owned" and "Block" are badly non-parallel, both grammatically and semantically. I suggest "Resource" instead of "Owned". (We can keep "Block" -- it's not too bad, IMO.) -->

<!--
Dhruv:
We use the word "resources" to describe any "resource predicate" owned, or user-defined, (and eventually live allocations and locks) so I'm not sure that suggestion works any better. It is just a points-to with read and write permissions, so perhaps a RW(p)? (or ReadWrite(p)?).

@bcpierce00
Both of these are better than Owned!

(And then Block can become WriteOnly.)

BCP: I think this discussion is reflected in the GitHub exchange
-->

Given a C-type `T` and pointer `p`, the resource `Owned<T>(p)` asserts ownership of a memory cell at location `p` of the size of C-type `T`. It is CN’s equivalent of a points-to assertion in separation logic (indexed by C-types `T`).

In this example we can ensure the safe execution of `read` by adding a precondition that requires ownership of `Owned<int>(p)`, as shown below. For now ignore the notation `take ... = Owned<int>(p)`. Since reading the pointer does not disturb its value, we also add a corresponding postcondition, whereby `read` returns ownership of `p` after it is finished executing, in the form of another `Owned<int>(p)` resource.

```c title="solutions/read.c"
--8<--
solutions/read.c
--8<--
```

This specification means that:

- any function calling `read` has to be able to provide a resource `Owned<int>(p)` to pass into `read`, and

- the caller will receive back a resource `Owned<int>(p)` when `read` returns.

### Resource outputs

A caller of `read` may also wish to know that `read` actually returns the correct value, the pointee of `p`, and also that it does not change memory at location `p`. To phrase both we need a way to refer to the pointee of `p`.

<!-- TODO: BCP: The idea that "resources have outputs" is very mind-boggling to many new users, _especially_ folks with some separation logic background. Needs to be explained very carefully. Also, there's some semantic muddle in the terminology: Is a resource (1) a thing in the heap, (2) a thing in the heap that one is currently holding, or (3) the act of holding a thing in the heap? These are definitely not at all the same thing, but our language at different points suggests all three! To me, (1) is the natural sense of the word "resource"; (2) is somewhat awkward, and (3) is extremely awkward. -->

In CN, resources have _outputs_. Each resource outputs the information that can be derived from ownership of the resource. What information is returned is specific to the type of resource. A resource `Owned<T>(p)` (for some C-type `T`) outputs the _pointee value_ of `p`, since that can be derived from the resource ownership: assume you have a pointer `p` and the associated ownership, then this uniquely determines the pointee value of `p`.

<!-- TODO: BCP: ... in a given heap! (The real problem here is that "and the associated ownership" is pretty vague.) -->
<!-- Dhruv: Perhaps mentioning sub-heaps will help? -->

CN uses the `take`-notation seen in the example above to bind the output of a resource to a new name. The precondition `take P = Owned<int>(p)` does two things: (1) it assert ownership of resource `Owned<int>(p)`, and (2) it binds the name `P` to the resource output, here the pointee value of `p` at the start of the function. Similarly, the postcondition introduces the name `P_post` for the pointee value on function return.

<!-- TODO: BCP: But, as we've discussed, the word "take" in the postcondition is quite confusing: What it's doing is precisely the _opposite_ of "taking" the resournce, not taking it but giving it back!! It would be much better if we could choose a more neutral word that doesn't imply either taking or giving. E.g. "resource". -->

<!-- TODO: BCP: This might be a good place for a comment on naming conventions. Plus a pointer to a longer discussion if needed -->

That means we can use the resource outputs from the pre- and postcondition to strengthen the specification of `read` as planned. We add two new postconditions specifying

1. that `read` returns `P` (the initial pointee value of `p`), and
1. that the pointee values `P` and `P_post` before and after execution of `read` (respectively) are the same.

```c title="exercises/read2.c"
--8<--
exercises/read2.c
--8<--
```

_Aside._ In standard separation logic, the equivalent specification for `read` could have been phrased as follows (where `\return` binds the return value in the postcondition):

<!-- TODO: Sainati: as a separation logic noob, I would love a more detailed explanation about what is going on here. -->

<!-- Why do we need to have v2 existentially quantified, for example, when p is only pointing to a single value? -->

```
∀p.
∀v1.
{ p ↦ P }
read(p)
{ \return. ∃P_post. (p ↦ P_post) /\ return = P /\ P = P_post }
```

CN’s `take` notation is just an alternative syntax for quantification over the values of resources, but a useful one: the `take` notation syntactically restricts how these quantifiers can be used to ensure CN can always infer them.

### Linear resource ownership

In the specifications we have written so far, functions that receive resources as part of their precondition also return this ownership in their postcondition.

Let’s try the `read` example from earlier again, but with a postcondition that does not return the ownership:

```c title="exercises/read.broken.c"
--8<--
exercises/read.broken.c
--8<--
```

CN rejects this program with the following message:

```
cn verify exercises/read.broken.c
[1/1]: read
build/exercises/read.broken.c:4:3: error: Left_Sublist-over unused resource 'Owned<signed int>(p)(v1)'
return \*p;
^~~~~~~~~~
Consider the state in /var/folders/\_v/ndl32wpj4bb3y9dg11rvc8ph0000gn/T/state_17eb4a.html
```

CN has typechecked the function and verified (1) that it is safe to
execute under the precondition (given ownership `Owned<int>(p)`)
and (2) that the function (vacuously) satisfies its postcondition. But
following the check of the postcondition it finds that not all
resources have been "`used up`".

Indeed, given the above specification, `read` leaks memory: it takes ownership, does not return it, but also does not deallocate the owned memory or otherwise dispose of it. In CN this is a type error.

CN’s resources are _linear_. This means not only that resources cannot be duplicated, but also that resources cannot simply be dropped or "`forgotten`". Every resource passed into a function has to be either _returned_ to the caller or else _destroyed_ by deallocating the owned area of memory (as we shall see later).

CN’s motivation for linear tracking of resources is its focus on
low-level systems software in which memory is managed manually; in
this context, memory leaks are typically very undesirable. As a
consequence, function specifications have to do precise bookkeeping of
their resource footprint and, in particular, return any unused
resources back to the caller.

### Exercises

_Quadruple_. Specify the function `quadruple_mem`, which is similar to the earlier `quadruple` function, except that the input is passed as an `int` pointer. Write a specification that takes ownership of this pointer on entry and returns this ownership on exit, leaving the pointee value unchanged.

```c title="exercises/slf_quadruple_mem.c"
--8<--
exercises/slf_quadruple_mem.c
--8<--
```

_Abs_. Give a specification to the function `abs_mem`, which computes the absolute value of a number passed as an `int` pointer.

```c title="exercises/abs_mem.c"
--8<--
exercises/abs_mem.c
--8<--
```

### Block resources

Aside from the `Owned` resources seen so far, CN has another
built-in type of resource called `Block`. Given a C-type `T` and
pointer `p`, `Block<T>(p)` asserts the same ownership as
`Owned<T>(p)` — ownership of a memory cell at `p` the size of type
`T` — but, in contrast to `Owned`, `Block` memory is not assumed
to be initialised.

CN uses this distinction to prevent reads from uninitialised memory:

- A read at C-type `T` and pointer `p` requires a resource
  `Owned<T>(p)`, i.e., ownership of _initialised_ memory at the
  right C-type. The load returns the `Owned` resource unchanged.

- A write at C-type `T` and pointer `p` needs only a
`Block<T>(p)` (so, unlike reads, writes to uninitialised memory
are fine). The write consumes ownership of the `Block` resource
(it destroys it) and returns a new resource `Owned<T>(p)` with the
value written as the output. This means the resource returned from a
write records the fact that this memory cell is now initialised and
can be read from.
<!-- TODO: BCP: Not sure I understand "returns a new resource `Owned<T>(p)` with the value written as the output" -- perhaps in part because I don't understand what the output of a resource means when the resource is not in the context o a take expression. -->

Since `Owned` carries the same ownership as `Block`, just with the
additional information that the `Owned` memory is initalised, a
resource `Owned<T>(p)` is "`at least as good`" as `Block<T>(p)` —
an `Owned<T>(p)` resource can be used whenever `Block<T>(p)` is
needed. For instance CN’s type checking of a write to `p` requires a
`Block<T>(p)`, but if an `Owned<T>(p)` resource is what is
available, this can be used just the same. This allows an
already-initialised memory cell to be over-written again.

Unlike `Owned`, whose output is the pointee value, `Block` has no meaningful output.

### Writing through pointers

Let’s explore resources and their outputs in another example. The C function `incr` takes an `int` pointer `p` and increments the value in the memory cell that it poinbts to.

```c title="exercises/slf0_basic_incr.signed.c"
--8<--
exercises/slf0_basic_incr.signed.c
--8<--
```

In the precondition we assert ownership of resource `Owned<int>(p)`,
binding its output/pointee value to `P`, and use `P` to specify
that `p` must point to a sufficiently small value at the start of
the function so as not to overflow when incremented. The postcondition
asserts ownership of `p` with output `P_post`, as before, and uses
this to express that the value `p` points to is incremented by
`incr`: `P_post == P + 1i32`.

If we incorrectly tweaked this specification and used `Block<int>(p)` instead of `Owned<int>(p)` in the precondition, as below, then CN would reject the program.

```c title="exercises/slf0_basic_incr.signed.broken.c"
--8<--
exercises/slf0_basic_incr.signed.broken.c
--8<--
```

CN reports:

```
build/solutions/slf0_basic_incr.signed.broken.c:6:11: error: Missing resource for reading
int n = \*p;
^~
Resource needed: Owned<signed int>(p)
Consider the state in /var/folders/\_v/ndl32wpj4bb3y9dg11rvc8ph0000gn/T/state_5da0f3.html
```

The `Owned<int>(p)` resource required for reading is missing, since, per the precondition, only `Block<int>(p)` is available. Checking the linked HTML file confirms this. Here the section "`Available resources`" lists all resource ownership at the point of the failure:

- `Block<signed int>(p)(u)`, i.e., ownership of uninitialised memory
  at location `p`; the output is a `void`/`unit` value `u`
  (specified in the second pair of parentheses)

- `Owned<signed int*>(&ARG0)(p)`, the ownership of (initialised)
  memory at location `&ARG0`, i.e., the memory location where the
  first function argument is stored; its output is the pointer `p`
  (not to be confused with the pointee of `p`); and finally

- `__CN_Alloc(&ARG0)(void)` is a resource that records allocation
  information for location `&ARG0`; this is related to CN’s
  memory-object semantics, which we ignore for the moment.

<!-- TODO: BCP: These bullet points are all a bit mysterious and maybe TMI. More generally, we should double check that this is actually the information displayed in the current HTML output... -->
<!-- Dhruv: It is displayed, but hidden. And perhaps TMI right now, but once the memory model lands properly, will sadly be the price of entry to writing verifiable (semantically well-defined) C. -->

### Exercises

_In-place double._ Give a specification for the function `inplace_double`, which takes an `int` pointer `p` and doubles the pointee value: specify the precondition needed to guarantee safe execution and a postcondition that captures the function’s behaviour.

--8<--
exercises/slf3_basic_inplace_double.c
--8<--
```

### Multiple owned pointers

When functions manipulate multiple pointers, we can assert their
ownership just like before. However
pointer ownership in CN is unique -- that is, simultaneously owning
`Owned` or `Block` resources for two pointers implies that these
pointers are disjoint.

The following example shows the use of two `Owned` resources for
accessing two different pointers by a function `add`, which reads
two `int` values in memory, at locations `p` and `q`, and
returns their sum.

<!-- TODO: BCP: Hmmm -- I'm not very sure that the way I've been naming things is actually working that well. The problem is that in examples like this we computer "thing pointed to by p" at both C and CN levels. At the C level, the thing pointed to by p obviously cannot also be called p, so it doesn't make sense for it to be called P at the CN level, right? Maybe we need to think again, but hoinestly I am not certain that it is _not_ working either. So I'm going to opush on for now... -->

```c title="exercises/add_read.c"
--8<--
exercises/add_read.c
--8<--
```

This time we use C’s `unsigned int` type. In C, over- and underflow of unsigned integers is not undefined behaviour, so we do not need any special preconditions to rule this out. Instead, when an arithmetic operation at unsigned type goes outside the representable range, the value "`wraps around`".

The CN variables `P` and `Q` (resp. `P_post` and `Q_post`) for the pointee values of `p` and `q` before (resp. after) the execution of `add` have CN basetype `u32`, so unsigned 32-bit integers, matching the C `unsigned int` type. Like C’s unsigned integer arithmetic, CN unsigned int values wrap around when exceeding the value range of the type.

Hence, the postcondition `return == P + Q` holds also when the sum of `P` and `Q` is greater than the maximal `unsigned int` value.

<!-- TODO: BCP: I wonder whether we should uniformly use i32 integers everywhere in the tutorial (just mentioning in the bullet list below that there are other integer types, and using i64 for calculations that may overflow). Forgetting which integer type I was using was a common (and silly) failure mode when I was first working through the tutorial. -->
<!-- Dhruv: Sensible. -->
<!-- BCP: ... On second thought, maybe settling on u32 instead of i32 in most places is better (fewer things to prove). Or maybe it doesn't matter much. For the start of the tutorial, i32 is important because the examples are all about overflow. But after that we could go either way. -->

In the following we will sometimes use unsigned integer types to focus on specifying memory ownership, rather than the conditions necessary to show absence of C arithmetic undefined behaviour.
