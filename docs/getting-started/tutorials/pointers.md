# Working with pointers

So far we’ve only considered functions manipulating numeric
values. Specifications become more interesting when _pointers_ are
involved, because the safety of memory accesses via pointers has to be
taken into account.

CN uses _separation logic resources_ and the concept of _ownership_ to
reason about memory accesses. A _resource_, intuitively, represents
the permission to access a region of memory.

Let’s look at a simple example. The function `read` takes an integer
pointer `p` and returns the pointee value.

```c title="exercises/read.c"
--8<--
exercises/read.c
--8<--
```

Running `cn test` on this example produces an error that looks like this:
```
Testing read::read:
FAILED

************************ Failed at *************************
function read, file ./read-exec.c, line 19
Load failed.
  ==> 0x12294ca70[0] (0x12294ca70) not owned
********************** Failing input ***********************

unsigned int* p = (unsigned int*)(12294ca70);
read(p);
```

For the read `*p` to be safe, we need to know that the function has permission
to access the memory pointed to by `p`. We next explain how to represent this
permission.

## RW resources

Given a C-type `T` and pointer `p`, the resource `RW<T>(p)` asserts
_ownership_ of a memory region at location `p` of the size of the C type
`T`.

{{ hidden("BCP: The description of the T argument could be postponed
   for a while, if we removed `<unsigned int>` annotations everywhere.
   But I'm not convinced that this suppressing is helpful; it really
   depends whether real C code often uses pointers to things whose
   size CN can determine automatically, and I don't have a clear
   enough picture of what those are...") }}

In this example, we can ensure the safe execution of `read` by adding
a precondition that requires ownership of `RW<unsigned int>(p)`, as
shown below. (The `take ... =` part will be explained shortly.) Since
reading the pointer does not disturb its value,
we can also add a corresponding postcondition, whereby `read` returns
ownership of `p` after it is finished executing, in the form of
another `RW<unsigned int>(p)` resource.

```c title="solutions/read.c"
--8<--
solutions/read.c
--8<--
```

This specification can be read as follows:

- any function calling `read` has to be able to provide a resource
  `RW<unsigned int>(p)` to pass into `read`, and

- the caller will receive back a resource `RW<unsigned int>(p)` when
  `read` returns.

## Pointee values

In addition to reasoning about memory accesed by pointers, we likely also want
to reason about the actual values that the pointers point to. The `take P =` in
the precondition assigns the name `P` to the pointee value of `p`.

That means we can use the pointee values from the pre- and postcondition to
strengthen the specification of `read`. We add two new postconditions specifying

1. that `read` returns `P`, the initial pointee value of `p`, and
1. that the pointee values `P` and `P_post` before and after execution of `read` (respectively) are the same.

```c title="exercises/read2.c"
--8<--
exercises/read2.c
--8<--
```

??? note "Aside (for separation-logic experts)"
    _Aside._ In standard separation logic, the equivalent specification for `read` could have been phrased as follows (where `\return` binds the return value in the postcondition):

    {{ todo("    Sainati: as a separation logic noob, I would love a more detailed explanation about what is going on here.
    ") }}

    {{ todo("     Why do we need to have v2 existentially quantified, for example, when p is only pointing to a single value?
    ") }}

    ```
    ∀p.
    ∀P.
    { p ↦ P }
    read(p)
    { \return. ∃P_post. (p ↦ P_post) and return = P and P = P_post }
    ```

    CN’s `take` notation is just an alternative syntax for quantification over the values of resources, but a useful one: the `take` notation syntactically restricts how these quantifiers can be used to ensure CN can always infer them.

### Exercises

_Exercise:_ Write a specification for `double_it`, which takes a pointer `p` and
returns double the pointee value. Running `cn test` on this correct
implementation should succeed,
```c title="exercises/double_it.c"
--8<--
exercises/double_it.c
--8<--
```
while running `cn test` on this incorrect implementation
```C
  unsigned int n = *p;
  unsigned int m = n + n;
  *p = 0;
  return m;
```
and this incorrect implementation
```C
  unsigned int n = *p;
  unsigned int m = n + n + n;
  return m;
```
should fail.

## Writing through pointers

We next have an example where data is written to a pointer. The function
`incr` takes a pointer `p` and increments the value in the memory cell that it
points to.

```c title="exercises/slf0_basic_incr.c"
--8<--
exercises/slf0_basic_incr.c
--8<--
```

The precondition binds the initial pointee value to `P`. The postcondition binds
the value _after_ function execution to `P_post`, and uses this to express that
the value `p` points to is incremented by `incr`: `P_post == P + 1i32`.

### Exercises

_Exercise:_ Write a specification for `inplace_double`, which takes a pointer
`p` and doubles the pointee value. Make sure your postcondition captures the
function's intended behavior.

```c title="exercises/slf3_basic_inplace_double.c"
--8<--
exercises/slf3_basic_inplace_double.c
--8<--
```

## No memory leaks

In the specifications we have written so far, functions that receive resources as part of their precondition also return this ownership in their postcondition.

Let’s try the `read` example from earlier again, but without such a postcondition:

```c title="exercises/read.broken.c"
--8<--
exercises/read.broken.c
--8<--
```

CN rejects this program with the following message:
```
Testing read::read:
FAILED

************************ Failed at *************************
function read, file ./read.broken-exec.c, line 26
Postcondition leak check failed, ownership leaked for pointer 0x1201e8a78

********************** Failing input ***********************

void* p0 = malloc(4);
*((unsigned int*)p0) = 17;
unsigned int* p = (unsigned int*)(p0);
read(p);
```

The error from `cn test` report
tells us (1) in which function the error occurred, (2) what happened
("ownership leaked"), and (3) a failing input — i.e., a snippet of C
code that will construct a heap state on which the test fails in this
way.

What went wrong here is that, given the above specification, `read`
leaks memory: it takes ownership, does not return it, but also does
not deallocate the RW memory or otherwise dispose of it.
CN requires that every resource passed into a function has to be either
_returned_ to the caller or else _destroyed_ by deallocating the RW area of
memory (as we shall see later).

CN’s motivation for this choice is its focus on low-level systems software in
which memory is managed manually; in this context, memory leaks are typically
very undesirable. As a consequence, function specifications have to do precise
bookkeeping of their resource footprint and, in particular, return any unused
resources back to the caller.

## Disjoint memory regions

When functions manipulate multiple pointers, we can assert ownership of each
one, just like before. But there is an additional twist: simultaneously owning
resources for two pointers implies that these pointers refer to _disjoint_
regions of memory.

Consider this example to see when disjointness matters:

```c title="exercises/five_six.c"
--8<--
exercises/five_six.c
--8<--
```

The postcondition claims that the function returns `5`. Observe that this is
only true when `p` and `q` are disjoint; otherwise, the write to `q` would
override the write to `p`. In CN, we can make this assumption for free — no
extra work is needed to assert that the pointers are disjoint.

### Exercises

_Exercise:_ Write a specification for the function `transfer`, shown below.

```c title="exercises/slf8_basic_transfer.c"
--8<--
exercises/slf8_basic_transfer.c
--8<--
```

## Ownership of structured objects

So far, our examples have worked with just integers and pointers, but
larger programs typically also manipulate compound values, often
represented using C `struct`s. Specifying functions manipulating
structs works in much the same way as with basic types.

For instance, the following example uses a `struct point` to
represent a point in two-dimensional space. The function `transpose`
swaps a point’s `x` and `y` coordinates.

```c title="exercises/transpose.c"
--8<--
exercises/transpose.c
--8<--
```

Here we have `RW<struct point>(p)` resources, with the appropriate type of `p`
filled in. Accordingly, `P` and `P_post` are values with type `struct point`,
i.e., they are records with members `x` and `y`. The postcondition asserts the
coordinates have been swapped by referring to the members of `P` and `P_post`
individually.

{{ later("It would be nice to add an exercise that involves
using the error messages to find a bug.") }}
