# More on numeric types (verification)

{{ todo("Section under construction...") }}

    TODO
    - We need to talk in another (non-optional) section about signed types in the
      context of specification and testing.
    - Talk here about CN's signed numeric types, sizes, conversions,
      overflow, etc.

So far, we have worked entirely with unsigned 32-bit integers. These
are simpler to deal with than C's signed integers, which introduce the
possibility of _undefined behavior_.

## Signed arithmetic and undefined behavior

The simple arithmetic function `add` shown below takes `int` arguments `x` and `y` and returns their sum.

```c title="exercises/add_0.c"
--8<--
exercises/add_0.c
--8<--
```

Running `cn verify` on the example produces an error message:

```
cn verify exercises/add_0.c
[1/1]: add
exercises/add_0.c:3:10: error: Undefined behaviour
return x+y;
~^~
an exceptional condition occurs during the evaluation of an expression (§6.5#5)
Consider the state in /.../state_393431.html
```

CN rejects the program because it has _undefined behaviour_ according to the C standard, meaning it is not safe to execute. CN points to the relevant source location, the addition `x+y`, and paragraph §6.5#5 of the standard, which specifies the undefined behaviour. It also includes a link to an HTML file with more details on the error to help in diagnosing the problem.

Inspecting this HTML report (as we do in a moment) gives us possible example values for `x` and `y` that cause the undefined behaviour and hint at the problem: for very large values for `x` and `y`, such as `1073741825` and `1073741824`, the sum of `x` and `y` can exceed the representable range of a C `int` value: `1073741825 + 1073741824 = 2^31+1`, so their sum is larger than the maximal `int` value, `2^31-1`.

Here `x` and `y` are _signed integers_, and in C, signed integer _overflow_ is undefined behaviour (UB). Hence, `add` is only safe to execute for smaller values. Similarly, _large negative_ values of `x` and `y` can cause signed integer _underflow_, also UB in C. We therefore need to rule out too-large values for `x` and `y`, both positive and negative, which we do by writing a CN function specification.

### First function specification

Shown below is our first function specification, for `add`, with a precondition that constrains `x` and `y` such that the sum of `x` and `y` lies between `-2147483648` and `2147483647`, so within the representable range of a C `int` value.

```c title="solutions/add_0.c"
--8<--
solutions/add_0.c
--8<--
```

In detail:

- Instead of C syntax, CN uses Rust-like syntax for integer types, such as `u32` for 32-bit unsigned integers and `i64` for signed 64-bit integers, to make their sizes unambiguous. Here, `x` and `y`, of C-type `int`, have CN type `i32`.{{ hidden("BCP: I understand this reasoning, but I wonder whether it introduces more confusion than it avoids -- it means there are two ways of writing everything, and people have to remember whether the particular thing they are writing right now is C or CN... Hopefully we are moving toward unifying these notations anyway? ") }}

- To define `Sum` we cast `x` and `y` to the larger `i64` type, using syntax `(i64)`, which is large enough to hold the sum of any two `i32` values.

- Finally, we require this sum to be between the minimal and maximal `int` values. Integer constants, such as `-2147483648i64`, must specifiy their CN type (`i64`).

Running CN on the annotated program passes without errors. This means that, with our specified precondition, `add` is safe to execute.

We may, however, wish to be more precise. So far, the specification gives no information to callers of `add` about its output. To describe its return value we add a postcondition to the specification using the `ensures` keyword.

```c title="solutions/add_1.c"
--8<--
solutions/add_1.c
--8<--
```

Here, we specify that  the return value is equal to `Sum`
as defined in the precondition, cast back to `i32` type: that is, `add`
returns the sum of `x` and `y`.

Running CN confirms that this postcondition also holds.

One final refinement of this example. CN defines constant functions `MINi32`, `MAXi64`, etc. so that specifications do not need to be littered with unreadable numeric constants.

```c title="solutions/add_2.c"
--8<--
solutions/add_2.c
--8<--
```

Two things to note: (1) These are constant _functions_, so they
require a following `()`. And (2) The type of `MINi32()` is `i32`, so
if we want to use it as a 64-bit constant we need to add the explicit
coercion `(i64)`.

## Error reports

{{ todo("Update") }}

In the original example, CN reported a type error due to C undefined
behavior. While that example was perhaps simple enough to guess the
problem and solution, this can become quite challenging as program and
specification complexity increases. Diagnosing errors is
therefore an important part of using CN. CN tries to help with this by
producing detailed error information, in the form of an HTML error
report.

Let’s return to the type error from earlier -- `add` without
precondition -- and take a closer look at this report.

_CN error report_
![*CN error report: 0*](images/0_error.png)

_Definitions and constraints not handled automatically_

CN checks that the code matches its specification with the help of an SMT
solver. CN passes a set of constraints along with program context to the SMT
solver, which either confirms that a given constraint will always hold in
that program context, provides a counterexample in which the constraint does
not hold, or times out. To avoid timeouts, CN avoids passing some definitions
to the solver, including recursive functions, some predicates with branching,
and constraints with `forall`. The error file displays in this section which
definitions and constraints CN did not pass to the solver.

_Resources that do not satisfy predicate definitions_

Because CN does not pass certain definitions to the solver, it may return
spurious counterexamples that do not respect those definitions. Consider this
example:

![*CN error report: string*](images/string_error.png)

`String` is a predicate representing a null-terminated string.
In general, CN does not know how much to unfold the mutually recursive
predicates `String` and `StringAux`, so it does not pass their full
definition to the solver. This leads to a spurious counterexample: `sIn` is the
singleton string containing exactly the null character `0u8`. This is
impossible; the predicate leaves out the null when constructing the logical
representation of a string. To make clear that this is a bad counterexample,
the error file lists `String(s) (sIn)` under _Resources that do not satisfy
predicate definitions_.

_Path to error._ The first section contains information about the
control-flow path leading to the error.

When checking a C function, CN examines each possible control-flow
path individually. If it detects UB or a violation of user-defined
specifications, CN reports the problematic control-flow path as a
nested structure of statements: the path is split into sections that
group together statements between high-level control-flow positions
(e.g. function entry, the start of a loop, the invocation of a
`continue`, `break`, or `return` statement, etc.); within each
section, statements are listed by source code location; finally, per
statement, CN lists the typechecked sub-expressions, and the memory
accesses and function calls within these.

In our example, there is only one possible control-flow path: entering
the function body (section "`function body`") and executing the W
from lines 2 to 4, followed by the return statement at line 3. The
entry for the latter contains the sequence of sub-expressions in the
return statement, including reads of the variables `x` and `y`.

In C, local variables in a function, including its arguments, are
mutable, their addresses can be taken and passed as values. CN
therefore represents local variables as memory allocations that are
manipulated using memory reads and writes. Here, type checking the
return statement includes checking memory reads for `x` and `y`,
at their locations `&ARG0` and `&ARG1`. The path report lists
these reads and their return values: the read at `&ARG0` returns
`x` (that is, the value of `x` originally passed to `add`); the
read at `&ARG1` returns `y`. Alongside this symbolic information,
CN displays concrete values:

- `1073741825i32 /* 0x40000001 */` for x (the first value is the decimal representation, the second, in `/*...*/` comments, the hex equivalent) and

- `1073741824i32 /* 0x40000000 */` for `y`.

For now, ignore the pointer values `{@0; 4}` for `x` and `{@0; 0}` for `y`.

{{ todo("BCP: Where are these things discussed? Anywhere? (When) are they useful? ") }}
{{ todo("Dhruv: These are part of VIP memory model things I'm working on, which will hopefully be implemented and enabled in the next few weeks. ") }}

These concrete values are part of a _counterexample_: a concrete
valuation of variables and pointers in the program that that leads to
the error. (The exact values may vary on your machine, depending on
the SMT solver -- i.e., the particular version of Z3, CVC5, or
whatever installed on your system.)

_Proof context._ The second section, below the error trace, lists the proof context CN has reached along this control-flow path.

"`Available resources`" lists the RW resources, as discussed in later sections.

"`Variables`" lists counterexample values for program variables and pointers. In addition to `x` and `y`, assigned the same values as above, this includes values for their memory locations `&ARG0` and `&ARG1`, function pointers in scope, and the `__cn_alloc_history`, all of which we ignore for now.

{{ todo("BCP: Again, where are these things discussed? Should they be? ") }}
{{ todo("Dhruv: Also VIP. ") }}

Finally, "`Constraints`" records all logical facts CN has learned along the path. This includes user-specified assumptions from preconditions or loop invariants, value ranges inferred from the C-types of variables, and facts learned during the type checking of the statements. Here -- when checking `add` without precondition -- the only constraints are those inferred from C-types in the code:

- For instance, `good<signed int>(x)` says that the initial value of
  `x` is a "`good`" `signed int` value (i.e. in range). Here
  `signed int` is the same type as `int`, CN just makes the sign
  explicit.
  {{ todo("BCP: Yikes! This seems potentially confusing ") }}

  For an integer type `T`, the type `good<T>` requires the value to
  be in range of type `T`; for pointer types `T`, it also requires
  the pointer to be aligned. For structs and arrays, this extends in the
  obvious way to struct members or array cells.
  {{ todo("BCP: Is this information actually ever useful? Is it currently suppressed? ") }}

- `repr<T>` requires representability (not alignment) at type `T`, so `repr<signed int*>(&ARGO)`, for instance, records that the pointer to `x` is representable at C-type `signed int*`;

- `aligned(&ARGO, 4u64)`, moreover, states that it is 4-byte aligned.

{{ todo("URGENT: BCP: Some of the above (especially the bit at the end) feels like TMI for many/most users, especially at this point in the tutorial. ") }}
{{ todo("Dhruv: Probably true, we actually even hide some of these by default. ") }}
{{ todo(" BCP: I propose we hide the rest and move this discussion to somewhere else ('Gory Details' section of the tutorial, or better yet reference manual). ") }}
{{ todo("Dhruv: Thumbs up ") }}

### Another arithmetic example

Let’s apply what we know so far to another simple arithmetic example.

The function `doubled`, shown below, takes an int `n`, defines `a` as `n` incremented, `b` as `n` decremented, and returns the sum of the two.

```c title="exercises/slf1_basic_example_let.signed.c"
--8<--
exercises/slf1_basic_example_let.signed.c
--8<--
```

We would like to verify this is safe and that `doubled` returns twice the value of `n`. Running CN on `doubled` leads to a type error: the increment of `a` has undefined behaviour.

As in the first example, we need to ensure that `n+1` does not overflow and `n-1` does not underflow. Similarly `a+b` has to be representable at `int` type.

```c title="solutions/slf1_basic_example_let.signed.c"
--8<--
solutions/slf1_basic_example_let.signed.c
--8<--
```

We encode these expectations using a similar style of precondition as in the first example. We first define `N` as `n` cast to type `i64` — i.e. a type large enough to hold `n+1`, `n-1`, and `a+b` for any possible `i32` value for `n`. Then we specify that decrementing `N` does not go below the minimal `int` value, that incrementing `N` does not go above the maximal value, and that `n` doubled is also in range. These preconditions together guarantee safe execution.

{{ todo("BCP: How about renaming N to n64? ") }}
{{ todo("Dhruv: Sensible. ") }}
{{ todo(" BCP: (someone do it on next pass) ") }}

To capture the functional behaviour, the postcondition specifies that `return` is twice the value of `n`.

### Exercises

_Quadruple._ Specify the precondition needed to ensure safety of the C function `quadruple`, and a postcondition that describes its return value.

```c title="exercises/slf2_basic_quadruple.signed.c"
--8<--
exercises/slf2_basic_quadruple.signed.c
--8<--
```

_Abs._ Give a specification to the C function `abs`, which computes the absolute value of a given `int` value. To describe the return value, use CN’s ternary "`_ ? _ : _`" operator. Given a boolean `b`, and expressions `e1` and `e2` of the same basetype, `b ? e1 : e2` returns `e1` if `b` holds and `e2` otherwise.
Note that most binary operators in CN have higher precedence than the ternary operator, so depending on your solution you may need to place the ternary expression in parentheses.
