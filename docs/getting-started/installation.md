# Installation

To fetch and install CN, visit the [Cerberus repository](https://github.com/rems-project/cerberus) and follow the instructions in [backend/cn/README.md](https://github.com/rems-project/cerberus/blob/master/backend/cn/README.md).

Once the installation is completed, type `cn --help` in your terminal to ensure CN is installed and found by your system. This should print the list of available options CN can be executed with.

To use CN to verify a C file, run `cn verify CFILE`.

To use CN to test a C file, run `cn test CFILE`.
