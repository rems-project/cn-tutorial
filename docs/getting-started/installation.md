# Installation

To fetch and install CN, visit the [Cerberus repository](https://github.com/rems-project/cerberus) and follow the instructions in [backend/cn/README.md](https://github.com/rems-project/cerberus/blob/master/backend/cn/README.md).

Once the installation is completed, type `cn --help` in your terminal to ensure CN is installed and found by your system. This should print the list of available options CN can be executed with.

To apply CN to a C file, run `cn verify CFILE`.

Install the [language
server](https://github.com/GaloisInc/VERSE-Toolchain/tree/main/cn-lsp/server)
and [VSCode
plugin](https://github.com/GaloisInc/VERSE-Toolchain/tree/main/cn-lsp/client)
for a better IDE experience.
