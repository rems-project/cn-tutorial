/** Description
  
  Typical of Java is its systematic use of exceptions, via its statements for throwing
and catching. They require a suitable control flow semantics. Special care is
needed for the ‘finally’ part of a try-catch-finally construction. Figure 4 contains
a simple example (adapted from [17]) that combines many aspects. The subtle
point is that the assignment m+=10 in the finally block will still be executed,
despite the earlier return statements, but has no effect on the value that is
returned. The reason is that this value is bound earlier.

NOTE: C doesn't handle exceptions. In the translation below, we use an
if statement to discriminate the input, making the example rather
trivial.

    } else {
        result = m / d; // Normal division
    }

    m += 10; // This corresponds to the 'finally' block in Java, executed regardless of exception
