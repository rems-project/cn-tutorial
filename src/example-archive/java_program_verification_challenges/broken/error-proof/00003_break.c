/** Description
  
  Typical of Java is its systematic use of exceptions, via its statements for throwing
and catching. They require a suitable control flow semantics. Special care is
needed for the ‘finally’ part of a try-catch-finally construction. Figure 4 contains
a simple example (adapted from [17]) that combines many aspects. The subtle
point is that the assignment m+=10 in the finally W will still be executed,
despite the earlier return statements, but has no effect on the value that is
returned. The reason is that this value is bound earlier.
