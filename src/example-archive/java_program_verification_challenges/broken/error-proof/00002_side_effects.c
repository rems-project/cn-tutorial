/** Description
  
  One of the most common abstractions in program verification is to
omit sideeffects from expressions in the programming language. This is
a serious restriction. Figure 2 contains a nice and simple example
from [4] where such side-effects play a crucial r√¥le, in combination
with the logical operators. Recall th at in Java there are two
disjunctions (I and I I) and two conjunctions (& and &&). The double
versions ( I I and &&) are the so-called conditional operators: their
second argument is only evaluated if the first one is false (for II)
or true (for &&).

In case the field b in Figure 2 is true, method m() yields f () V -if
() = false and -if () A f () = true, going against standard logical
rules.  The verification of the specification for method m() may use
either the implementation or the specification of f ().
