## Lemma export build forlder

This folder will be copied to be used as a build folder for exported lemmas. Lemmas should be extracted into the `theories/ExportedLemmas.v` and proofs, if any, should be written in `theories/Proofs.v`

From the `_CoqProject` a Makefile should be generated automatically.
