/** Description: 

    Rust's ownership system is governed by three main rules:
    
    1. Each value in Rust has an owner.
    2. There can only be one owner at a time.
    3. When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.

    In Rust, the code below would fail to typecheck because the
    assignment from `s1` to `s2` transfers the ownership of the
    pointer from `s1` to `s2`. Consequently, `s1` becomes unusable
    while `s2` is in scope.


    In contrast, CN treats ownership not as an attribute of an entity,
    but as a transient aspect of the program's executionâ€”a 'ghost
    state' that does not impact performance. As a result, there are no
    ownership transfers in CN, allowing verification of the example
    without issues.

    
    Note that in Rust, `use_string` accepts a slice, which is
    essentially a 'fat pointer' comprising a pointer, a length, and a
    capacity. To achieve a similar functionality in C, we must
    explicitly pass the length `len` as an argument. More details
    about slices can be found in `slices.c`."
